Specifically, despite the invalidity of the actualistically objectionable principles BF, CBF, and \\(\\Box\\textbf{N},\\) it is questionable whether KQML has escaped ontological commitment to possibilia, for the following reason. KQML provides us with a formal semantics for (constant-free) modal languages \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) and, in particular, an account of how the truth value of a given formula \\(\\varphi\\) of \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) is determined in an interpretation by the meanings assigned to its semantically significant component parts, notably, the meanings of its predicates.  As noted above  in our exposition of SQML, truth-in-a-model is not the same as truth simpliciter. However, given an  applied modal language  \\(\\scrL_\\Box,\\) we were able to define a notion of modal truth simpliciter for formulas of \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) in terms of truth in an intended interpretation, an interpretation \\(\\calM\\) for \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) comprising the very things that the language is intuitively understood to be “about”. Thus, when \\(\\calM\\) is an intended SQML interpretation, the things it is about are the honest-to-goodness actual and merely possible individuals in the domain \\(D\\) of \\(\\calM\\) and the honest-to-goodness possible worlds of \\(W\\). In particular, if our applied language is one in which \\(\\Diamond\\exists \\sfx\\, \\sfB\\sfx\\) is meant to express that Bergoglio might have had children, \\(D\\) will include at least some of his merely possible children and \\(W\\) will contain a world in which some of them are, in fact, his children and hence concrete and, hence, in which they are actual in the sense of  A!Def.  There is thus, more generally, for each world \\(w \\in W,\\) the set \\(D_w\\) of things in \\(D\\) that are actual in \\(w\\). Note, however, that, in light of this, we can transform \\(\\calM\\) into a KQML interpretation \\(\\calK_\\calM\\) simply by defining a function \\(\\mathit dom\\) that, for each world \\(w \\in W,\\) returns exactly the set \\(D_w\\). However, that is simply a formal modification that affects the evaluation of quantified formulas at worlds; it does not alter \\(\\calK_\\calM\\)’s ontological commitments, which are still exactly those of \\(\\calM\\). But there seems no other way to construct a notion of an intended Kripke interpretation that will yield the right truth values for propositions like  (2).  From this perspective, the invalidity of BF, CBF, and \\(\\Box\\textbf{N}\\) in KQML—in particular, their falsity in an intended Kripke interpretation \\(\\calK_\\calM\\)—results from a simple adjustment of the semantical apparatus with no substantive change in the metaphysics. So instead of a genuinely actualist alternative to the possibilist commitments of SQML, KQML appears to remain no less steeped in them—the denizens of other worlds that are not in the domain of the actual world simply fail to be actual in the sense of  A!Def.  Of course, this metalinguistic fact cannot be expressed in \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\)—even if one adds the actuality predicate to \\(\\scrL_\\Box,\\) due to the quantifier restrictions in the semantics of KQML, the assertion that there are things that aren’t actual, \\(\\exists \\sfx\\, \\neg \\sfA!\\sfx,\\) will be false in \\(\\calK_\\calM\\) at every world. But that does not make the possibilist commitments of \\(\\calK_\\calM\\)  disappear.[63]",

Rather, the role of Kripke’s possible world semantics is simply to get the intuitive validities right; soundness and completeness proofs for KQML then demonstrate that the system preserves those intuitive validities and, hence, that it is a trustworthy vehicle for reasoning directly about the modal facts of the matter. The formal semantics proper is just a useful device toward this end. However, on the face of it, anyway, this instrumentalist take on Kripke’s semantics is an uncomfortable one for the actualist. Consider ordinary Tarskian semantics for classical first-order logic FOL. Intuitively, this semantics is more than just a formal instrument. Rather, an intended interpretation for a given applied language \\(\\scrL\\) shows clearly how the semantic values of the relevant parts of a formula of \\(\\scrL\\)—the objects, properties, relations, etc. in the world those parts signify—contribute to the actual truth value of the sentence. The semantics thus provides insight into the “word-world” connection that explains how it is that sentences of natural language can express truth and falsity, how they can carry good and bad information. The possibilist is able to generalize this understanding of the semantics of first-order languages directly to modal languages \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\). The embarrassing question for the actualist who would take the proposed instrumentalist line on Kripke’s semantics is: what distinguishes Kripkean semantics from Tarskian? Why does the latter yield insight into the word-world connection and not the former? Actualists owe us either an explanation of how Kripke’s semantics can be understood non-instrumentally without entailing possibilism or a plausible instrumentalist answer to the possibilist challenge. The former option is explored in  §4.2,  the latter in  §4.3  and  §4.4.",

If, however, one takes possible world semantics of some ilk seriously, so that possibility and necessity are correlated in some manner with truth at some or all possible worlds, then, insofar as possibilia are said to exist in non-actual possible worlds, such worlds are themselves reasonably classified as some variety of possibilia themselves, some variety of merely possible, non-existent object.

A state of affairs \\(s\\) is possible if it possibly obtains; \\(s\\) includes another state of affairs \\(s'\\) if, necessarily, \\(s\\) obtains only if \\(s'\\) does and \\(s\\) excludes \\(s'\\) if it is not possible that both \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) obtain; \\(s\\) is maximal if, for any state of affairs \\(s',\\) \\(s\\) either includes or excludes \\(s'\\).

It is easy to show that, under those definitions, a state of affairs is a possible world just in case it possibly includes all and only the states of affairs that obtain.

Intuitively, the essential properties of an object are the ones that make the object “what it is”. For example, on at least some conceptions of human persons, being human is essential to Bergoglio while being Catholic isn’t—there is (on these conceptions) no possible world containing Bergoglio in which he fails to be human but many in which he, say, becomes a Buddhist monk or is a lifelong atheist. A property is an essence of an object \\(a,\\) then, just in case (i) it is essential to \\(a\\) and (ii) nothing but \\(a\\) could have exemplified it; and a property is an essence simpliciter just in case it is possibly an essence of something.",

Plantinga’s diagnosis, roughly put, is that Kripke’s semantics gets the structure of the modal universe right but that it needs his worlds and haecceities to realize that structure in an actualistically acceptable way. Specifically, an intended haecceitist interpretation \\(\\calH\\) for an applied modal language \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) is a Kripke interpretation that specifies sets \\(D\\) and \\(W\\) as usual, but \\(W\\) is a sufficiently expansive set of Plantinga’s maximal possible states of affairs and \\(D\\) a corresponding set of haecceities. The domain function \\(\\textit{dom}\\) as usual will map each possible world \\(w\\) to a subset of \\(D,\\) i.e., to a set of haecceities that Plantinga refers to as the essential domain of \\(w\\). This is the set of haecceities that are exemplified in \\(w,\\) where a haecceity \\(h\\) is exemplified in \\(w\\) just in case \\(w\\) includes the state of affairs \\(h\\)’s being exemplified. Otherwise put, the essential domain \\(\\textit{dom}(w)\\) of \\(w\\) consists of those haecceities that would have been exemplified if \\(w\\) had obtained.

On the face of it, however, insofar as the formal operators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\) are taken to symbolize their English counterparts, defining the modal operators would appear to be exactly what possible world semantics purports to do. For, unlike  the classical connectives and quantifiers,  in basic possible world semantics the modal operators are not interpreted homophonically. That is, they are not interpreted with the very natural language operators they are intended to represent—a necessitation \\(\\Box\\psi,\\) in particular, is not defined to be true in an interpretation just in case \\(\\psi\\) is necessarily true in it. Rather, in basic possible world semantics, the necessity operator is interpreted as a restricted universal quantifier: a necessitation \\(\\Box\\psi\\) is true in an interpretation \\(\\calM\\) just in case \\(\\psi\\) is true at every possible world of \\(\\calM\\). However, whether or not that proves to be a definition of the necessity operator depends on what one takes a possible world to be.  David Lewis  famously  defined possible worlds  to be (typically) large, scattered concrete objects similar in kind but spatio-temporally unconnected to our own physical universe. Under such an understanding of possible worlds, possible world semantics arguably provides a genuine definition of the modal operators on which the truth conditions assigned to modal formulas do not themselves involve any modal  notions.[69]  As it is sometimes put, such a definition is “eliminative” or “reductive”—modal notions are eliminated in the semantics in favor of quantification over (non-modal) worlds.",

        "text": " As robust as the haecceitist solution is, many actualists find that it grates against some very strong intuitions, especially about the nature of properties.   But there is a deeper issue dividing the haecceitists from other actualists. To clarify, consider that many propositions are singular in form. That is, unlike general propositions like all whales are mammals, some propositions are “directly about” specific individuals—for example, the proposition Marie Curie was a German citizen. Call the individuals a singular proposition is directly about the subjects of the proposition. Singular propositions are typically expressed by means of sentences involving names, pronouns, indexicals, or other devices of direct reference. As we’ve seen, possibilists believe that there are singular propositions whose subjects are not actual, viz., propositions about mere possibilia: for the possibilist, recall,  (2)  is grounded in singular propositions of the form \\(a\\) is Bergoglio’s child, for possibilia \\(a\\). Similarly, haecceitists like Plantinga, although actualists in the strict sense, also believe there are singular possibilities that are in a derivative but clear sense directly about things that don’t exist, viz., those possibilities involving unexemplified haecceities like \\(h\\) is coexemplified with being Bergoglio’s child. Say that a strict actualist is an actualist who rejects the idea that there are, or even could be, singular propositions that are directly about things that do not exist in either the possibilist’s or the haecceitist’s sense. It follows that, had some actually existing individual \\(a\\) failed to exist, there would have been no singular propositions about \\(a\\); or, as Prior puts it, there would have been no facts about \\(a,\\) not even the fact that \\(a\\) fails to exist (see, e.g., Prior 1957: 48–49); or again: singular propositions supervene on the individuals they are about. For the strict actualist, then, necessarily, all propositions are either wholly general or, at most, are directly about existing individuals only.",

The answer of course depends entirely on what one takes to be a “systematically and philosophically satisfying” account of the truth conditions for modal assertions like  (2).  Possibilists (and their haecceitist and eliminitivist counterparts) clearly consider preservation of Tarski-style compositionality (formalized in an appropriate notion of an intended interpretation) to be essential for meeting this element of the challenge: one must ultimately be able to ground the truth of complex modal statements in the modal properties of (perhaps nonactual, perhaps abstract) individuals. But it is not at all clear that the strict actualist must agree. They might well rather simply reject this demand and insist instead that  (2)  and its like stand on their own and do not need the sort of grounding that possibilists insist upon. Since this is simply a consequence of the rejection of possibilia and their actualist proxies, from the strict actualist perspective, it is a philosophically satisfying result. The apparent loss of Tarski-style compositionality is, for the strict actualist, a price worth  paying.[71]  From this perspective, possible world semantics can with some justification be seen as nothing more than a useful but ontologically inert formal instrument, an evocative but ultimately dispensable philosophical  heuristic.[72]  In that case, the only serious challenge that possibilism raises for the strict actualist is the formulation of an actualistically kosher quantified modal deductive system whose basic principles intuitively reflect strict actualist sensibilities. We turn now to two of the best known accounts. (We will follow common practice and refer to a deductive system with or without a corresponding formal model theory as a  logic.[73])",

To see this for the particular case of SQML’s  \\(\\Diamond\\textbf{Def}\\),  consider, say, the obvious truth that Bergoglio is not a subatomic particle—say, a proton, \\(\\neg \\sfP\\sfb\\). Since Bergoglio is a contingent being, there are worlds where he doesn’t exist. Hence, there are worlds where \\(\\neg \\sfP\\sfb\\) fails to be statable and thus, by Gap, where it is neither true nor false and thus in particular where it is not true. It follows that \\(\\neg \\sfP\\sfb\\) is not necessary, \\(\\neg\\Box\\neg \\sfP\\sfb.\\) But, obviously, \\(\\Diamond \\sfP\\sfb\\) does not follow; assuming that Bergoglio is essentially human, it is not possible that he is a proton. So \\(\\Diamond\\textbf{Def}\\) will not do. By the same token, if Bergoglio is essentially human, it is impossible that he fail to be human, \\(\\neg\\Diamond\\neg \\sfH\\sfb\\). For \\(\\neg \\sfH\\sfb\\) is obviously not true in worlds where he exists, and in worlds where he doesn’t, it is not statable and hence, by Gap again, neither true nor false and thus again not true. But \\(\\Box \\sfH\\sfb\\) does not follow; for \\(\\sfH\\sfb\\) is also not statable, hence not true, in Bergoglio-free worlds. So necessity cannot be defined as usual in terms of possibility—impossible falsehood does not imply necessary truth. Rather, necessity is impossible falsehood plus necessary statability.
