We may call this the way of abstraction principles. Wright (1983) and Hale (1987) have developed an account of abstract objects on the basis of an idea they trace back to certain suggestive remarks in Frege (1884). Frege notes (in effect) that many of the singular terms that appear to refer to abstract entities are formed by means of functional expressions. We speak of the shape of a building, the direction of a line, the number of books on the shelf. Of course, many singular terms formed by means of functional expressions denote ordinary concrete objects: ‘the father of Plato’, ‘the capital of France’. But the functional terms that pick out abstract entities are distinctive in the following respect: where \\(f(a)\\) is such an expression, there is typically an equation of the form:",

That is, it is unlikely that mastery of the concept of set will presuppose mastery of the equivalence relation that figures on the right hand side.

This notion of a statement’s holding in virtue of the meaning of a word is notoriously problematic (see the entry  the analytic/synthetic distinction).

In each case, the abstract object is essentially the value of an abstraction function for a certain class of arguments. This is not a claim about the meanings of linguistic expressions. It is a claim about the essences or natures of the objects themselves. (For the relevant notion of essence, see Fine 1994.) So for example, the Fregean number two (if there is such a thing) is, essentially, by its very nature, the number that belongs to a concept \\(F\\) if and only if there are exactly two \\(F\\text{s}\\).

The simplest approach is to say that a thing depends on the mind when it would not (or could not) have existed if minds had not existed. But this entails that tables and chairs are mind-dependent, and that is not what philosophers who employ this notion have in mind. To call an object ‘mind-dependent’ in a metaphysical context is to suggest that it somehow owes its existence to mental activity, but not in the boring ‘causal’ sense in which ordinary artifacts owe their existence to the mind. What can this mean? One promising approach is to say that an object should be reckoned mind-dependent when, by its very nature, it exists at a time if and only if it is the object or content of some mental state or process at that time. This counts tables and chairs as mind-independent, since they might survive the annihilation of thinking things. But it counts paradigmatically mental items, like a purple afterimage of which a person \\(X\\) may become aware, as mind-dependent, since it presumably lies in the nature of such items to be objects of conscious awareness whenever they exist. However, it is not clear that this account captures the full force of the intended notion. Consider, for example, the mereological fusion of \\(X\\)’s afterimage and \\(Y\\)’s headache. This is surely a mental entity if anything is. But it is not necessarily the object of a mental state. (The fusion can exist even if no one is thinking about it.) A more generous conception would allow for mind-dependent objects that exist at a time in virtue of mental activity at that time, even if the object is not the object of any single mental state or act.

First, it opens the door to thinking that besides abstract and concrete entities (assuming that physical objects, in a broad sense, are concrete), there are mental entities that are neither concrete nor abstract. As mentioned above (section 1.2), there is no need to insist that the distinction is an exhaustive one. Second, while the approach may well draw an important line, it inherits one familiar problem, namely, that of saying what it is for a thing to be a physical object (Crane and Mellor 1990; for discussion, see the entry on  physicalism).  In one sense, a physical entity is an entity in which physics might take an interest. But physics is saturated with mathematics, so in this sense a great many paradigmatically abstract objects—e.g. \\(\\pi\\)—will count as physical. The intended point is that abstract objects are to be distinguished, not from all of the objects posited by physics, but from the concrete objects posited by the physics. But if that is the point, it is unilluminating in the present context to say that abstract objects are non-physical.",

So if something has no location in time, it is causally inefficacious. The theory of relativity implies that space and time are nonseparable, i.e., combined into a single spacetime manifold. So the above proposal might be restated in terms of a single condition: an object is abstract if and only if it is non-spatiotemporal.

It is not unnatural to say that a set of books is located on a certain shelf in the library, and indeed, there are some theoretical reasons for wanting to say this (Maddy 1990).

If they are considered concrete, then one might ask where the spatiotemporal points or regions are located. And a similar question arises for spatial points and regions, and for temporal instants or intervals. So, the ontological status of spatiotemporal locations, and of spatial and temporal locations, is problematic. Let us suppose that space, or spacetime, exists, not just as an object of pure mathematics, but as the arena in which physical objects and events are somehow arrayed. It is essential to understand that the problem is not about the numerical coordinates that represent these points and regions (or instants and intervals) in a reference system; the issue is about the points and regions (or instants and intervals). Physical objects are located ‘in’ or ‘at’ regions of space; as a result, they count as concrete according to the non-spatiality criterion. But what about the points and regions of space itself? There has been some debate about whether a commitment to spacetime substantivalism is consistent with the nominalist’s rejection of abstract entities (Field 1980, 1989; Malament 1982). If we define the abstract as the ‘non-spatial’, this debate amounts to whether space itself is to be reckoned ‘spatial’. To reject that these points, regions, instants, and intervals, are concrete because they are not located, entails featuring them as abstract. However, to think about them as abstract sounds a bit weird, given their role in causal processes. Perhaps, it is easier to treat them as concrete if we want to establish that concrete entities are spatiotemporal—or spatial and temporal.",

These items are causally inefficacious if they exist, but they are not normally regarded as abstract. The proponent of the causal inefficacy criterion might respond by insisting that abstract objects are distinctively neither causes nor effects. But this is perilous. Abstract artifacts like Jane Austen’s novels (as we normally conceive them) come into being as a result of human activity. The same goes for impure sets, which come into being when their concrete urelements are created. These items are clearly effects in some good sense; yet they remain abstract if they exist at all.

There is surely some sense in which it does. The event consists in John’s coming to stand in a certain relation to the theorem, just as the rock’s hitting the window consists in the rock’s coming to stand in a certain relation to the glass.

If this is correct, \\(\\{A\\}\\) and \\(\\{B\\}\\) would be indiscernible, but (at least for some philosophers) distinct abstract objects, contrary to the discernibility criterion.[8] It is possible to counter-argue that we could happily accept impure sets as concrete; after all, it was always a bit unclear how they should be classified. Obviously, this has the problematic consequence of having some sets—pure sets—as abstract and other sets—impure sets—as concrete. But the idea that abstract objects have distinctive intrinsic natures allows one to establish a criterion less strong than that of discernibility; if an entity has a distinctive intrinsic nature, it cannot have a duplicate. So, the next criterion of non-duplication can be put forward:",

The theory explicitly defines the notion of an abstract object but also implicitly characterizes them using  axioms.[9]  There are three central aspects to the theory: (i) a predicate \\(E!\\) which applies to concrete entities and which is used to define a modal distinction between abstract and ordinary objects; (ii) a distinction between exemplifying relations and encoding properties (i.e., encoding 1-place relations); and (iii) a comprehension schema that asserts the conditions under which abstract objects exist.",

On this interpretation, a formula such as \\(\\exists x \\neg E!x\\), which is implied by the axioms described below, asserts “there is an object that fails to exist”. So, on this interpretation, the theory is Meinongian because it endorses non-existent objects.

Instead, the definition validates an intuition that numbers, sets, etc., aren’t the kind of thing that could be concrete. Though Zalta’s definition of abstract seems to comport with the way of primitivism—take concrete as primitive, and then define abstract as not possibly concrete—it differs in that (a) axioms are stated that govern the conditions under which abstract objects exist (see below), and (b) the features commonly ascribed to abstract objects are derived from principles that govern the property of being concrete. For example, Zalta accepts principles such as: necessarily, anything with causal powers is concrete (i.e., \\(\\Box \\forall x(Cx \\to E!x)\\)).

On this reading, the definitions and axioms of the theory convey what is meant by encoding and how it works. Intuitively, an abstract object encodes the properties by which we define or conceive of it, but exemplifies some properties contingently and others necessarily. Thus, the number 1 of Dedekind-Peano number theory encodes all and only its number-theoretic properties, and whereas it contingently exemplifies the property being thought about by Peano, it necessarily exemplifies properties such as being abstract, not having a shape, not being a building, etc. The distinction between exemplifying and encoding a property is also used to define identity: ordinary objects are identical whenever they necessarily exemplify the same properties while abstract objects are identical whenever they necessarily encode the same properties.",

These views suggest that abstract objects exist in some weaker sense. Various approaches therefore articulate what may be called the ways of weakening existence.

Each framework is established by developing a language that typically includes expressions for one or more kinds of entities in question, expressions for properties of the entities in question (including a general category term for each kind of entity in question), and variables ranging over those entities. Thus, a framework for the system of observable things has expressions that denote such things (‘the Earth’, ‘the Eiffel Tower’, etc.), expressions for properties of such things (‘planet’, ‘made of metal’, etc.), and variables ranging over observables.

For this criterion appears to draw a line between certain pure abstract entities and everything else. The truth of simple existence statements about \\(\\{\\textrm{Bob Dylan}\\}\\) or Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, which usually are considered abstract entities, does not depend solely on linguistic rules. The same goes for simple and complex existential statements with general terms such as ‘novel’, ‘legal statute’, etc.",

Carnap rejects the question whether these objects are real in a metaphysical sense. But, contrary to the nominalist, he rejects the idea that we can truly deny the real existence of abstract objects (i.e., a denial that is external to a linguistic framework). This attitude, which settles the question of which framework to adopt on pragmatic grounds (e.g., which framework best helps us to make sense of the data to be explained), is the reason why we’ve labeled his view as a way of weakening existence.

        "text": " Proposals by other philosophers are related to Carnap’s view. Resnik (1997, Part Two) has put forward a postulational epistemology for the existence of mathematical objects. According to this view, all one has to do to ensure the existence of mathematical objects is to use a language to posit mathematical objects and to establish a consistent mathematical theory for  them.[16]  Nevertheless, their existence does not result from their being posited. Instead, we recognize those objects as existent because a consistent mathematical theory for them has been developed. Resnik requires both a linguistic stipulation for considering mathematical objects and a coherency condition for recognizing them as existent. Thomasson (2015, 30–34) advocates for an approach which she takes to be inherited from Carnap. She calls it easy ontology. Since she is not trying to find ultimate categories or a definitive list of basic (abstract or concrete) objects, she prefers a simpler kind of realism (see Thomasson 2015, 145–158). She argues that everyday uses of existential statements provide acceptable ontological commitments when those assertions are supported either by empirical evidence or merely by the rules of use that govern general terms (e.g., sortal terms); in both cases she says that “application conditions” for a general term are fulfilled (see Thomasson 2015, 86, 89–95). She, too, therefore offers a criterion of linguistic rules for accepting abstract objects. Given her defense of simple realism, it appears that she takes both observable objects and theoretical entities in science as concrete.",

        "text": " In what follows, two ways of formulating criteria for the abstract/concrete distinction are considered. The views start with the idea that our concept of an object allows for objects whose existence places very few demands on reality over and above the demands imposed by claims that do not mention abstract objects. Those philosophers who maintain this philosophical thesis are what Linnebo (2012) calls metaontological minimalists. Their proposals are typically put forward in connection with issues in the philosophy of mathematics, but then applied to other domains.",

        "text": " Parsons (1990), Resnik (1997), and Shapiro (1997) contend that, in the case of mathematical theories, coherence suffices for the existence of the objects mentioned in those  theories.[17]  They do not offer an explicit criterion for distinguishing abstract and concrete objects. Nevertheless, their proposals implicitly draw the distinction; abstract objects are those objects that exist in virtue of the truth of certain modal claims. In particular, the existence of mathematical objects is “grounded in” pure modal truths. For example, numbers exist “in virtue of” the fact that there could have been an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence of objects; sets exist because there might be entities that satisfy the axioms of one or another set theory, etc. Since these pure modal truths are necessary, this explains why pure abstract objects exist necessarily. It also explains a sense in which they are insubstantial: their existence is grounded in truths that do not (on the face of it) require the actual existence of anything at  all.[18] ",
