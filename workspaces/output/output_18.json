As such, they are a methodological improvement that has generally gained a positive reception among philosophers of biology (e.g., Sterelny and Griffiths 1999). Many biologists agree, but controversy continues. Some acknowledge the potential importance of comparative methods but point to limitations that may reduce their usefulness (Reeve and Sherman 2001, Leroi et al. 1994). As such, these critiques are consistent with methodological adaptationism. Others view any allusion to potential non-adaptive influences on trait evolution to be mistaken; in their view, the importance of phylogenetic methods is that they help reveal complete history of natural selection on the trait (Grafen 1989). As such, this is a critique consistent with the espousal of empirical adaptationism.",

This approach has the assumption that there is direct selection on the trait under analysis. This is often justified on the grounds that there exists a “good fit” between the trait and its current function (Maynard Smith 1978) or that natural selection is ubiquitous in nature (Mayr 1983).

For example, interaction between loci (linkage or pleiotropy) can prevent the optimal phenotype from being fixed in a population, and thereby prevent the maximization of mean fitness (Moran 1964). Such a deviation from the state of highest fitness is called genetic load. The standard adaptationist response is that genetic and ecological constraints are eliminated over evolutionary time by the introduction of new genetic variation via mutation (Parker and Maynard Smith 1990).",

        "text": "   While this controversy has been divisive (Schwartz 2002), there are prospects for a synthesis. First, Eshel and Feldman (2001) distinguished between “short-term evolution”, the evolutionary dynamics of a fixed set of genotypes, and “long-term evolution”, bouts of short-term evolution interspersed with introductions of new genetic variation. They noted (page 162) that “long-term evolution proceeds by an infinite sequence of transitions from one fixed set of genotypes to another fixed set of genotypes, with each of these sets subject to short-term evolution…” Optima are often not accessible in the short-term due to constraints on available variation. However, genetic variation may be introduced over the long term so that the population eventually reaches an optimum. The substantive point is that we now understand how apparent short-term impediments to optimality can be resolved over the long term. Mutations must appear at the right time and the ecology must remain stable over the long term; whether these conditions are met frequently enough in nature to justify the optimality approach is an empirical issue (see also Hammerstein 1996). The second prospect for synthesis is Wilkins and Godfrey Smith's (2009) proposal that the truth of empirical adaptationism, and the concomitant application of optimality models, depends on the intended “grain” of resolution of the evolutionary analysis. At a fine grain of resolution, when there are few peaks in the adaptive landscape, most observed populations may be on or near these peaks. Adaptationism is appropriate at this resolution. If we “zoom out” and look at a grand landscape over large regions of morphospace, the situation changes. At a very coarse grain of resolution, much of morphospace is empty and constraints often explain why certain regions remain unexplored by biological evolution. Adaptationism is inappropriate at this resolution.",

Instead, quantitative agreement and an assessment of nature of possible between-individual heterogeneity of fit to model predictions are required in order to have evidence for optimality; without both of these test components, acceptance of the hypothesis of optimality is not warranted (see above).",

They object that the concept of optimality is a poor tool for answering their research questions. The recognition of two kinds of constraints resolves this dispute. We see then that optimality modeling usually entails the incorporation of or the discovery of constraints on adaptation, whereas studies of evolution and development investigates constraints on form.

        "text": "   Developmental and genetic constraint hypotheses do not invoke causal processes in the same way that adaptive hypotheses do. Can such different hypotheses compete with one another? This aspect of the adaptationism debate connects biology to an important puzzle about the nature of causation and explanation. If explanation amounts to identifying causes, then constraints must be causes to explain evolutionary outcomes. But how can impediments have a causal influence on the evolutionary trajectory of a lineage? One possible answer is that they don't have any causal influence—they are merely the background against which natural selection operates. Such a view treats causes as part of a process, or involving some kind of energy transfer (Dowe 2008). This view of causation vindicates the adaptationist view that the constraint set is presupposed by any respectable adaptive hypothesis. For adaptationists, new constraints simply mean that we need to build new models. Testing is then just a matter of comparing different adaptive hypotheses that have different constraints. The other possible answer is that constraints do have a causal influence on evolution because they prevent evolutionary trajectories from attaining some outcomes. This view is consistent with counterfactual and interventionist approaches to causation, such as the comprehensive one defended by Woodward (2003), and vindicates the approach of treating constraints as genuine alternatives to adaptive hypotheses.",

Constraints are defined as biases or limitations on the production of variation. From the perspective of causation, this is a heterogeneous combination. Constraints that bias a lineage towards certain evolutionary trajectories look like productive probabilistic causes, and avoid certain conceptual entanglements that face boundaries or limitations. Innovations in the developmental makeup of an organism can make new changes and subsequent evolutionary trajectories more likely, a hallmark of a causal factor. This helps clarify the importance of evolutionary innovation. Innovations that produce biases may be crucial to explaining major evolutionary transitions, such as the emergence of multicellularity (Sterelny 2008). When certain changes make new evolutionary outcomes more likely they are part of the explanation of those new outcomes. Such biases count as probabilistic causal influences since they change the probability of a lineage taking certain evolutionary trajectories (Hitchcock 2008).",

A prevailing view within evolutionary biology is that constraints must count as causal influences, whatever our account of causation (whether it be by prevention or by omission, see Woodward 2003 for discussion). Gould and Lewontin (1979) adopted this position. Sansom (2003) argued that the debate over the evolutionary importance of constraint amounts to an issue about the relative causal contributions of constraint and natural selection to evolutionary outcomes. The causal contribution of constraint can be assessed by using comparative data in order to compare evolutionary outcomes of lineages with and without the constraint of interest. If there is a difference, then the constraint has an identifiable causal influence, all other things being equal. Pigliucci and Kaplan (2000, 2006) proposed a test protocol based on transition matrices in which probabilities of evolutionary change are specified under natural selection and under one or more competing constraint hypotheses, so as to test natural selection against constraint. More philosophical analysis is required to assess the viability of this approach.",

For example, Frank (1985) and Stubblefield and Seger (1990) analyzed the influence on sex ratio optima of different constraints on the information available to parents; Lloyd (2005) described the evidentiary support for explanations of the evolution of the female orgasm. Lloyd's analysis supports Symons' (1979) proposal that the female orgasm exists because of a developmental constraint in combination with strong selection for the male orgasm. If males fail to achieve orgasm then no reproduction occurs. The tissue responsible for the male orgasm appears early in human development, long before sexual dimorphism occurs, and this tissue is found in both male and female sexual organs. This example contains competing hypotheses that have commitments about boundaries and about natural selection. The Symons constraint explanation invokes a feature of development and indirect selection on a different trait, whereas the adaptive hypothesis does not incorporate the developmental constraint and instead, posits a direct role for selection.",

However, the dynamics of canon formation resulted in her philosophical work being largely ignored until the  1990s.[1]  Addams is best known for her pioneering activism in the social settlement movement—the radical arm of the progressive movement whose adherents so embraced the ideals of progressivism that they chose to live as neighbors in oppressed communities to learn from and help the marginalized members of society. Although her contemporaries widely lauded her activism and accomplishments, commentators typically mapped Addams’ work onto conventional gender understandings: male philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, and George Herbert Mead were regarded as providing original progressive thought, while Addams was seen as brilliantly administering their theories. Recent work by feminist philosophers and historians has revealed that Addams was far more than a competent practitioner. Her dozen published books, and over 500 articles display a robust intellectual interplay between experience and reflection in the American pragmatist tradition. The near half-century that she lived and worked as the leader of the Chicago social settlement, Hull House, allowed her to bring her commitment to social improvement, feminism, diversity, and peace into reflective practice. These experiences provided the foundation for an engaging philosophical perspective. Addams viewed her settlement work as a grand epistemological endeavor, but in the process, she never forgot her neighbors’ humanity. Addams was a public philosopher who was not afraid to get her hands dirty.",

Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and pacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic rather than ideological. Addams’ commitment to social cohesion and cooperation prompted her to eschew what she perceived as divisive distinctions. Active democratic social progress was so essential to Addams that she did not want to alienate any group of people from the conversation or the participation necessary for effective inclusive deliberation. Addams carefully varied her rhetorical approach to engaging a variety of constituencies, which makes identifying her social philosophy challenging. Accordingly, Addams did not intend to engage in philosophical narratives removed from social improvement, nor did she intend to pursue social activism without theorizing about the broader implications of her work. In this respect, through her integration of theory and action, Addams carried pragmatism to its logical conclusion through her integration of theory and action, developing an applied philosophy immersed in social action. Thus Addams’ writing is replete with examples from her Hull House experience addressing atypical topics for philosophic discourse, such as garbage collection, immigrant folk stories, and prostitution. It is easy for those steeped in traditional philosophy to dismiss Addams’ writings as non-philosophical if the full sweep of her projects and subsequent analysis is not considered. For those who persevere, Addams offers a rich social and political philosophy built on respect and understanding that is refreshing in its faith in the potential for collective progress.",

Therefore, her writing is nuanced, with references that require a contextual understanding of pertinent ideas of the time. Reading Addams, one finds a wellspring of nascent feminist philosophical insight. Addams’ ethical philosophy was guided by the notion of sympathetic knowledge that she described as “the only way of approach to any human problem” (NCA 7). Sympathetic knowledge is a mingling of epistemology and ethics: knowing one another better reinforces the common connection of people such that the potential for caring and empathetic moral actions increases. Addams not only theorized about this idea, but she lived it. Sympathetic knowledge underwrote Addams’ approach to the diversity and staggering poverty (HHM) that she confronted in the immigrant neighborhood surrounding Hull House and allowed her to develop a precursor to contemporary feminist standpoint epistemology. Addams’ leadership among the American pragmatists in understanding the poor and oppressed resulted in a more radical form of pragmatism than Dewey and James, a social philosophy imbued with a class and gender consciousness.",

When Jane was two years old, her mother, Mary, died giving birth to her ninth child. Subsequently, the precocious Addams doted upon her father and benefited emotionally and intellectually from his attention. Although John Addams was no advocate of feminism, he desired higher education for his daughter. Therefore, he sent her to the all-women’s institution, Rockford Seminary (renamed later Rockford College) in Rockford, Illinois. As a result, Addams became part of a generation of women that were among the first in their families to attend college. At Rockford, she experienced the empowerment of living in a women-centered environment, and she blossomed as an intellectual and a social leader. Her classmates and teachers acknowledged this leadership. Ultimately, Addams spearheaded an effort to bring baccalaureate degrees to the school and, after serving as class valedictorian, received the first one.",

She made a failed attempt at medical school and then, precipitated by her father’s death, slipped into a nearly decade-long malaise over the direction of her life. At first, the energy and spirit of her undergraduate college experience did not translate into any clear career path, given that she had rejected both marriage and religious life. Moreover, Addams’ malady was somewhat analogous to the unidentified illness that her later acquaintance, Charlotte Perkins Gilman (as described in The Yellow Wallpaper), suffered. As a member of the privileged class, her soul searching included a trek to Europe, which Addams made twice during this period. On the second trip, she visited Toynbee Hall, a pioneering Christian settlement house in London, which was to inspire her in a direction that propelled her toward international prominence (TYH 53).",

After engaging the leaders of Toynbee Hall, Addams was rejuvenated by the idea of replicating the settlement in the United States. She enlisted a college friend, Ellen Gates Starr, in the plan. However, identifying their vague idea as a “plan” is a bit of hyperbole. There were very few specific blueprints for what the settlement would be other than a good neighbor to oppressed peoples. Nevertheless, Addams found a suitable location in a devastatingly poor Chicago immigrant neighborhood, and on September 18, 1889, Hull House opened its doors. Working amidst one of the most significant influxes of immigrants the United States has ever known, Hull House got off to a slow start as neighbors did not know what to make of the residents and their intentions. However, Addams and Starr built trust, and in a short time, Hull House became an incubator for new social programs and a magnet for progressives wanting to make society a better place. Without formal ideological or political constraints, the settlement workers responded to the neighborhood’s needs by starting project after project. The list of projects created at Hull House is astounding, including the first little theatre and juvenile court in the United States and the first playground, gymnasium, public swimming pool, and public kitchen in Chicago. In addition, the work of Hull House residents would result in numerous labor union organizations, a labor museum, tenement codes, factory laws, child labor laws, adult education courses, cultural exchange groups, and the collection of neighborhood demographic data. Hull House was a dynamo of progressive initiatives, all of which Addams oversaw.",

Although Hull House was co-educational, it was a woman-identified space. There were male residents at Hull House, some of whom later became prominent leaders. However, the policies, projects, decision-making, and methodologies of the Hull House community were gynocentric—foregrounding women’s experience, analysis, and concerns. Furthermore, although a few residents were married, most were single, and some were in committed relationships with other women. Given the drastic shifts in sexual mores in the twentieth century, the contemporary understanding of what it means to be lesbian cannot straightforwardly be mapped onto the late and post-Victorian eras. Still, it can be argued that Hull House was a lesbian-friendly space. Addams set the tone for this identification with her own long-term intimate relationships with women, first with Starr and then with Mary Rozet Smith (Brown, 2004).",

For example, in one published essay, Addams describes the application and reorganization of knowledge as the fundamental problem of modern life and then claims that settlements are like applied universities: “The ideal and developed settlement would attempt to test the value of human knowledge by action, and realization, quite as the complete and ideal university would concern itself with the discovery of knowledge in all branches” (FSS 187). This kind of reflective analysis and wider thematization of her work and the social settlement work was a hallmark of Addams’ writing. Because of her insightful reflections on the Hull House community, Addams became a popular author and sought-after public speaker. Eventually, she extended her cosmopolitan analysis to race, education, and world peace issues. For Addams, local experiences were always a springboard for political theorizing.",

Addams was a founding figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. Her popularity was such that when Theodore Roosevelt sought the presidential nomination of the Progressive Party in 1912, he asked Jane Addams to second the nomination, the first time a woman had participated in such an act. There was a gendered dimension to this popularity, however. Addams had challenged the borders of the public and private spheres through her work at Hull House. Still, her forays into masculine domains were masked by the “social housekeeping” characterization of the settlement activism. After World War I broke out in Europe, her outspoken pacifism and refusal to endorse the war or the U.S. entry into it was more gender role transgression than the public could tolerate from a woman. Addams’ popularity fell, and she became the victim of vicious gender-specific criticism. Biographer Allen Davis reports that one writer indicated that what Addams needed to disabuse her of her pacifism was “a strong, forceful husband who would lift the burden of fate from her shoulders and get her intensely interested in fancy work and other things dear to the heart of women who have homes and plenty of time on their hands” (240).

Addams chose intellectual resources that resonated with her notion of sympathetic knowledge in bringing about social progress. A few significant influences are recounted here. Addams read Thomas Carlyle’s (1795–1881) work while she was attending Rockford Seminary. Carlyle’s social morality held a particular appeal to Addams. He believed the universe was ultimately good and moral and led by a divine will that worked through society’s heroes and leaders. Carlyle wrote biographies of social saviors that came in the form of poets, kings, prophets, and intellectuals, mixing in commentary that explicated his moral philosophy. However, Carlyle’s heroes reflect the evolution of society, as different contexts require different leadership. These heroes can recognize the social dynamics at work and use them for the benefit of others. Carlyle’s heroes evolved. For Carlyle, everyone has a public duty and needs to find themselves or realize their place in the world and what their work on behalf of society should be. Because of his emphasis on powerful individuals, Carlyle was not particularly fond of democracy. Although Addams shed Carlyle’s notion of individualistic heroism and his disdain for democracy, she retained the valorization of moral action throughout her career. Furthermore, Carlyle’s morality was grounded in social relations: to be moral is to be in right relation with God and others. Carlyle’s relational ethic is a precursor to Addams’ notion of sympathetic knowledge.",

Although Ruskin maintained a certain elitism in his view that great people produced great art, he also saw such great cultural works as a manifestation of the well-being of society as a whole. The plight of the oppressed was tied to a sense of the aesthetic. Indeed, Addams’ valorization of art and culture, as exhibited in the appearance and activities of Hull House resonates with Ruskin’s aesthetics. For Addams, “Social Life and art have always seemed to go best at Hull House” (STY 354). Addams viewed art and cultural activities as reinforcing essential human bonds (DSE 29). Ruskin also influenced Arnold Toynbee and other future settlement workers by identifying the problems in large industrial cities and calling for reforms foreshadowing the safety nets typical of later welfare states. Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of self-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she sought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For example, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or came in late for work because “all human interest has been extracted from it” (SYC 129). Although Addams valued Ruskin’s moral imagination, the concept of labor, and ideas about transforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his romanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in social progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For Addams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions, even regarding moral philosophy.",

Unlike Carlyle, Tolstoy did not valorize individuals standing out from the crowd as exemplary moral paragons who wield socially ordained positions of power. Instead, he valued solidarity with the common laborer. Addams’ vast intellectual curiosity made such extremes in influences possible. Addams read Tolstoy’s works from the time she graduated from college until the last years of her life, and she often praised his writing in articles and book reviews. Tolstoy’s emphasis on working for and with the oppressed while writing novels and essays that influenced a wider audience resonated with Addams’ work and writings. However, Tolstoy was a moral idealist. He left everything behind to take up the plow and work as a typical farm laborer. Addams was moved by Tolstoy’s account, and—typical of her self-critical, thoughtful approach--she questioned her leadership role in the social settlement, but only for a short time.",

The meeting made a lasting impression on Addams (TYH 191–195). Tolstoy came in from working the fields to be introduced to Addams and her partner Mary Rozet Smith. The meeting began with Tolstoy questioning Addams’ fashion choice because the sleeves of her arms, consistent with the style of the time, had “enough stuff on one arm to make a frock for the girl” (TYH 192). Tolstoy was concerned that the trappings of material wealth alienated Addams from those she was working with. This criticism continued when Tolstoy learned that part of Hull House’s funding came from Addams’ estate, which included a working farm: “So you are an absentee landlord? Do you think you will help the people more by adding yourself to the crowded city than you would by tilling your own soil?” (TYH 192) The remarks humbled Addams, and, on her return to Hull House, she was determined to take up more direct labor by working in the new Hull House bakery. However, reality demonstrated how Tolstoy’s idealism was incompatible with her work in social settlements: “The half dozen people invariably waiting to see me after breakfast, the piles of letters to be opened and answered, the demand of actual and pressing human wants—were these all to be pushed aside and asked to wait while I saved my soul by two hours’ work at baking bread?” (TYH 197)",

If she engaged in the labor of the poor exclusively, she might alleviate her upper-class guilt. Still, she would no longer be working holistically toward changing the structure of society. Addams’ philosophy of civic activism valued engagement through ongoing presence and listening. Indeed, Hull House had a very flat and responsive organizational structure.

However, despite acknowledging that the term “settlement” was borrowed from London, she finds differences between the philosophies of Toynbee Hall and Hull House: “The American Settlement, perhaps has not so much a sense of duty of the privileged toward the unprivileged of the ‘haves’ to the ‘have nots,’ to borrow Canon Barnett’s phrase, as a desire to equalize through social effort those results which superior opportunity may have given the possessor” (FSS 322–323). Addams is very concerned about a sense of moral superiority attributed to settlement work. She always eschewed the notion that she was a charitable “lady bountiful.” Instead, she wanted to learn about others to develop the proper sympathies and strategies for assisting—sympathetic knowledge.

Dewey is considered one of the greatest American philosophers. His name, along with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Josiah Royce, is included in the traditional list of founding fathers of what is labeled American Pragmatism. His work appealed to Addams because they shared many of the same commitments, including the value of a robust democracy as well as the importance of education that engaged the student’s experience. Addams and Dewey were intellectual soul mates from the moment they met in 1892. Dewey visited Hull House shortly after it opened and before he moved to Chicago to teach at the University of Chicago. Following the meeting, Dewey expressed to Addams an appreciation for Hull House’s work, and he would become a frequent visitor. There was much intellectual cross-fertilization between Hull House and the University of Chicago and vice versa. Historian Rosalind Rosenberg describes Addams as a de facto adjunct professor at the University of Chicago. Mary Jo Deegan documents that Addams taught many college courses through the Extension Division of the University of Chicago for a decade. In addition, she refused offers to join the undergraduate and graduate faculty (Deegan, 1988). Furthermore, Dewey assigned Addams’ books in his courses. Addams and Dewey worked together personally and politically. When Hull House was incorporated, Dewey became one of the board members. He often lectured to the Plato Club, Hull House’s philosophy group. Dewey dedicated his book Liberalism and Social Action to Addams.

Julia Lathrop (1858–1932) was a Vassar graduate who, in 1912, after residing at Hull House for 22 years, became the first woman to head a federal agency, the Children’s Bureau, which, in terms of conduct, she modeled after Hull House. Rachel Yarros (1869–1946), a twenty-year resident at Hull House, was also a physician who taught at the University of Illinois. The university created a position for Yarros to recognize her tremendous contribution to social hygiene and sex education. Author and feminist theorist Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935) was a resident for a short time. Gilman thought highly of Addams but had no stomach for settlement existence amongst the oppressed. However, Gilman’s groundbreaking work on gender and economics likely influenced Addams. Sophonisba Breckinridge (1866–1948) graduated from Wellesley and obtained a Ph.D. in political science and a J.D. from the University of Chicago. Her most significant contribution was in the area of social work education. Edith Abbott (1876–1957) and her sister Grace Abbott (1878–1939) joined Hull-House about the time as Breckinridge (1907). Edith Abbott would obtain a Ph.D. in Political Economy from the University of Chicago, while Grace Abbott earned a Ph.D. from Grand Island College in Nebraska. Edith would have an academic career at the University of Chicago prior to her appointment as Chief of the Children’s Bureau after Julia Lathrop’s departure. Mary Kenney (1864–1943) became a vital labor organizer for Samuel Gompers’ American Federation of Labor and influenced Addams’ sensitivity to the plight of organized labor, something that all progressives did not share. Bessie Abramowitz Hillman, a Russian immigrant who attended classes at Hull House, founded the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in 1910 at the age of 20 and guided it for 60 years. Hillman referred to the settlement as “a House of Labor”, and she worked with and admired Addams until the latter’s passing. Another resident who became a significant labor leader was Alzina Stevens. She headed the Dorcas Federal Labor Union and became a member of the Council of Women’s Trade Unions of Chicago. Addams worked with and cultivated numerous labor leaders during this nascent time of the American labor movement. These are only a few of the more well-known residents, but numerous feminists used their Hull House experience as a springboard to careers in social reform or professions of various sorts. Addams engaged the residents of Hull House in conversation and deliberation such that they influenced her thoughts and she theirs.",

A Cornell graduate, Kelley translated Friedrich Engels’ The Condition of the Working Class in England and Karl Marx’s Free Trade into English. She was an active member of the Socialist Labor Party until the leadership, threatened by Kelley’s aggressive style, expelled her. A single mother with three children, Kelley found a home at Hull House, where she opened an employment center and began researching sweatshops for the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kelley would later become the general secretary of the new Consumer’s League, an organization dedicated to using consumer pressure to ensure that safe and high-quality goods were manufactured.

Addams was exceptionally well versed in the Christian bible and had attended several religious courses during her time at Rockford Seminary. Addams occasionally used religious language to help get her message out to Christian constituencies. Addams was also well acquainted with Greek philosophy and referenced Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in her work. Addams was attracted to the ability of Greek philosophers to move between personal and social concerns rather than compartmentalizing their philosophical analysis. Some have suggested that Addams was influenced by Auguste Comte (1798–1857) and the positivists (Misheva 2019). Comte, who coined the term “sociology,” believed sciences need their own logic drawn from experience rather than Descartes’s a priori universal rationalism. Addams would have been attracted to his ideas about social progress and his development of a religion of humanity. Addams also read a great deal of literature, which influenced her ideas concerning culture and sometimes seeped into her analysis, as it does when she uses Shakespeare’s King Lear to understand labor-management relations. Although she did not believe that reading was a substitute for direct experience, she did suggest more than once that reading great works of fiction as a means of developing a sympathetic understanding.",

Feminist philosophers have attended to the impact of context on theory more than mainstream philosophers. Although there are lively debates within feminist philosophical circles regarding the nature of objectivity, many, including Dorothy Smith, Nancy Hartsock, Hilary Rose, Alison Jaggar, and Sandra Harding, have developed the notion that knowledge is indeed situated. In particular, feminist standpoint theorists valorize the perspectives and theories derived from oppressed societal positions, such as women’s experiences. Harding describes a feminist standpoint as something to achieve rather than a passive perspective. All women have lived experience in a woman’s body and therefore have a woman’s perspective. Still, a feminist standpoint requires an effort at stepping back to gain a holistic picture of power struggles. Through the understanding of the perspectival aspect of knowledge claims, standpoint epistemology can create libratory knowledge that can be leveraged to subvert oppressive systems. One of the challenges of standpoint theory is how to give voice to multiple positions without falling back on hierarchies that favor certain standpoints over others.",

        "text": " Jane Addams demonstrates an appreciation for the spirit of standpoint theory through her work and writing at Hull-House. Despite the privileged social position she was born into, her settlement avocation immersed her in disempowered communities. Addams poetically describes her moral mandate to meet, know, and understand others: “We know at last, that we can only discover truth by a rational and democratic interest in life, and to give truth complete social expression is the endeavor upon which we are entering. Thus the identification with the common lot that is the essential idea of Democracy becomes the source and expression of social ethics. It is as though we thirsted at the great wells of human experience because we know that a daintier or less potent draught would not carry us to the end of the journey, going forward as we must in the heat and jostle of the crowd” (DSE 9). One might object that although these are admirable sentiments, they are still spoken by an outsider. What constitutes an outsider? Addams lived the better part of a half-century in the diverse immigrant neighborhood of Hull House in Chicago. She didn’t return home to the suburbs or return to a university office with her data. She lived and worked amongst the crime, civic corruption, prostitution, sweatshops, and other community ills. When they started Hull House, Addams and Starr were involved outsiders—an oddity that neighbors looked upon suspiciously. However, time, proximity, and an earnest desire to learn and help won the trust and respect of the neighborhood. The outsiders became insiders. When Addams wrote or spoke about single women laborers, child laborers, prostitutes, or first and second-generation immigrants, she employed first-hand knowledge gained from her social interactions. Addams leveraged her Hull House experiences to give voice to standpoints marginalized in society. Simultaneously, she worked to provide the oppressed their own voice through college extension courses, English language courses, and social clubs that fostered political and social debate. Addams was self-conscious about speaking for others: “I never addressed a Chicago audience on the subject of the Settlement and its vicinity without inviting a neighbor to go with me, that I might curb my hasty generalization by the consciousness that I had an auditor who knew the conditions more intimately than I could hope to do” (TYH 80). Addams did not try to arrive at universal moral truths but recognized that the standpoint of Hull House neighbors mattered.",

        "text": " In an 1896 article in The American Journal of Sociology, “A Belated Industry,” Addams addresses the plight of women in domestic labor. These were the most powerless of laborers: predominantly women, many of them immigrants with limited English language skills and in a job that afforded little legal protection or organizing possibilities. Addams begins the article with a footnote claiming that her knowledge of domestic laborers comes from her experience with the Woman’s Labor Bureau, one of the many Hull House projects. Addams goes on to address the powerlessness of domestic work, particularly as it entails isolation and a highly inequitable power relationship: “The household employé[sic] has no regular opportunity for meeting other workers of her trade, and of attaining with them the dignity of corporate body” (ABI 538). Addams identifies the gendered dimension of this oppressive work: “men would … resent the situation and consider it quite impossible if it implied the giving up of their family and social ties, and living under the roof of the household requiring their services” (ABI 540). Addams extrapolates her experience of these workers to imaginatively inhabit a standpoint and give them voice. She explicitly claims as much, “An attempt is made to present this industry [domestic labor] from the point of view of those women who are working in households for wages” (ABI 536). Addams repeatedly recognized the experiences of oppressed peoples that she came to know to have their concerns acknowledged in the social democracy she was trying to foster.",

Accordingly, if a voice is given to individuals inhabiting marginalized positions in society, it fosters the possibility of better understanding between people and actions that can lead to improving their lot. Addams engaged in the tricky balance of honoring standpoints while simultaneously seeking connections and continuities to build upon. This is exemplified in Addams’ books on young people, Youth and the City Streets, and elderly women, The Long Road of Woman’s Memory. The latter work is a treatise on memory based on the memories of first-generation immigrant women. Rather than grounding her theory upon the experiences of famous women theorists or writers—and Addams knew most of the prominent women of her day—Addams based her analysis on the women who were her neighbors at Hull House. Addams not only grounded her philosophical work in experience but in the experiences of those on the margins of society. Addams puts experience before theory. She did not begin by positing a theory about these women. Instead, she retold many stories she had heard from them and then drew out conclusions about the function of memory. For Addams, theory follows experience. Addams was in the minority among her peers in philosophy or feminism to believe that working-class immigrant women not only should be given a voice but also had something important to contribute to the community of ideas.",

        "text": " An example of Addams’ application of feminist standpoint theory (or at least a forerunner of it) can be seen in the “Devil Baby,” which recounts what transpired after three Italian women came to Hull House to see a possessed infant. One can form a whimsical image from Addams’ account, “No amount of denial convinced them that he was not there, for they knew exactly what he was like with his cloven hoofs, his pointed ears, and diminutive tail; the Devil Baby had, moreover, been able to speak as soon as he was born and was shockingly profane” (LRW 7–8). This would be an amusing anecdote if it stopped there, but Addams described a six-week period when Hull House was inundated with stories about the alleged Devil Baby. Visitors even offered Hull House residents money to see the creature despite adamant responses that there was no such baby. Multiple versions of how the Devil Baby arose in the neighborhood, and eventually the hysteria made the newspapers. One version of the story claimed that the Devil Baby was the offspring of an atheist and a devoted Italian girl. When the husband tore a holy picture from the wall claiming that he would rather have a devil in the house, his wish was granted in the form of his coming child (LRW 8). Although a fascinating social phenomenon, the Devil Baby story has little apparent philosophical importance. It would be easy to dismiss those who perpetuated the story as simpletons caught up in the hysteria. Not for Jane Addams. She applied a familiar approach by refusing to pass judgment, listening carefully, and developing a sympathetic understanding. Addams actively worked to grasp their subject position.",

She found women who were solemn and highly animated about the Devil Baby. They used the appearance of the Devil Baby and the excitement it created as an opportunity to discuss important and troubling matters of their life. Addams, who never sought simple answers to complex issues, found a convergence of class, race, and gender dynamics fueling the Devil Baby phenomenon. These immigrant women were in unfamiliar surroundings and had to adjust to foreign ideas and practices. They had been alienated by their children, who adapted to the new country more quickly, keeping the old ways at arm’s length. Many of these women also had been victims of domestic abuse long before such acts had a distinct label. One woman tells Addams, “My face has this queer twist for now nearly sixty years; I was ten when it got that way, the night after I saw my father do my mother to death with his knife” (LRW 11). For these forgotten and beaten women, the Devil Baby represented a connection to a past that made more sense to them: one that had clear moral imperatives. Another woman tells Addams, “You might say it’s a disgrace to have your son beat you up for the sake of a bit of money you’ve earned by scrubbing—your own man is different—but I haven’t the heart to blame the boy for doing what he’s seen all his life, his father forever went wild when the drink was in him and struck me to the very day of his death. The ugliness was born in the boy as the marks of the Devil was born in the poor child up-stairs” (LRW 11). Addams’ recounting of tale after tale of violence provides a depressing view of immigrant women’s lives at the turn of the century. For women who had lived such a hard life, the Devil Baby provided a momentary opportunity for resistance. Husbands and children would listen to them and temporarily forsake beating them for fear of divine retribution as evinced by the Devil Baby. Addams describes memory as serving to “make life palatable and at rare moments even beautiful” (LRW 28). Although this is a specific explanatory analysis, it demonstrates how Addams sought connections among the personal stories: “When these reminiscences, based upon the diverse experiences of my people unknown to each other, point to one inevitable conclusion, they accumulate into a social protest …” (LRW 29). Addams proceeds to view the Devil Baby in light of the women’s movement and the fight against oppression. Given the position of the old women, the Devil Baby was the vehicle of resistance and an opportunity for Addams to interject feminist analysis.",

Instead, Addams views unions as trailblazers who obtain working conditions that eventually benefit everyone in society: “trade unions are trying to do for themselves what the government should secure for all its citizens; has, in fact, secured in many cases” (FSS 456). Addams is not interested in improving the lot of one group of workers over another. “Any sense of division and suspicion is fatal in a democratic form of government, for although each side may seem to secure most for itself when consulting only its own interests, the final test must be the good of the community as a whole” (FSS 461).

Such a judgment serves to separate the wealthy from the poor. Accordingly, the rich can make progress intellectually, materially, technologically, etc., while the poor are thought to be left behind primarily due to their own actions.

Addams sought lateral progress that could be brought about by the collective will and manifested through social institutions. She believes there would be no need for settlements if “society had been reconstructed to the point of offering equal opportunity for all” (ONS 27). Addams is not advocating a laissez-faire capitalism version of equal opportunity that is abstract and rights-based.

She continually gave voice to women’s experiences, addressed women’s issues, and saw a vibrant social democracy as only possible if there was full participation by both men and women. When it came to issues such as women’s suffrage, Addams manifests a feminist pragmatism. “If women had no votes with which to select the men upon whom her social reform had become dependent, some cherished project might be so modified by uninformed legislatures during the process of legal enactment that the law, as finally passed, injured the very people it was meant to protect. Women had discovered that the unrepresented are always liable to be given what they do not want by legislators who merely wish to placate them” (STY 89–90). Note that Addams does not argue the application of abstract human rights, but she instead makes a functional claim about the role of voting in proper democratic representation. It is not that Addams opposes rights, but she will continually opt for pragmatist arguments on feminist issues.

        "text": " Although care is a simple and widely invoked word, many feminist theorists have invested it with a particular meaning as it applies to ethics. The original motivation for developing care ethics was an acknowledgment that traditional forms of morality, in particular principle-based and consequence-based ethics, did not adequately address the richness of the human condition. These approaches bracket out emotions, relationships, temporal considerations, reciprocity, and creativity to focus on immediate adjudication of moral conflicts. Accordingly, the use of rules or consequences can become a reductionist and formulaic response resulting in shortsighted answers to complex and systemic issues. For care ethicists, principles can be useful, but a concern for interpersonal connection tempers them. Principles and consequences can be important in moral deliberation, but care theorists seek a more robust and complex sense of morality that cannot ignore the context and people involved. For example, the claim that people who spray-paint graffiti on a building ought to be punished because they have damaged someone else’s property (rule/principle violation) will likely receive widespread assent. Care ethicists do not necessarily deny such an assertion, but they want to know more. The person doing the spray-painting is a human being whose motivations and circumstances may reveal other variables not sufficiently addressed by the mere recognition of rule violations. Systemic issues involving social opportunities, discrimination, or lack of voice may have contributed to this behavior. Care ethicists shift the moral focus from abstract individuals and their actions to concrete, situated people with feelings, friends, and dreams—persons who can be cared about. Care ethics demands effort, experience, knowledge, imagination, and empathy to effectively understand the totality of the moral context. The result is not an exoneration of personal responsibility but a richer understanding of the human condition where we are all actors and acted upon.",

        "text": " Addams consistently moves beyond formulaic moral accounts of principles or consequences to apply a kind of care ethics to her experiences in the Hull House neighborhood. Proximity is once again crucial as she has direct experience with individuals, providing the resources for a caring response. However, as a philosopher, Addams extrapolates her experiences to theorize about others of similar circumstances. For example, in The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets Addams addresses juvenile delinquency. She recounts charges against young men who were brought before the Juvenile Court in Chicago (which Hull House had helped establish). These charges were categorized by type, such as stealing, which included the pilfering of pigeons, blankets, and a bicycle. Another category was disorderly conduct which included picking up coal from railroad tracks, throwing stones at railroad employees, and breaking down a fence. There was also vagrancy, which included loafing, sleeping on the streets all night, and wandering (SYC 56–57). Addams does not deny the seriousness of some of these infractions, but she does not rush to judgment, instead choosing to investigate the context further. She talks to the young men and asks them about their motivations. She identifies a listlessness, a desire for adventure not quieted by what the city has to offer: “their very demand for excitement is a protest against the dullness of life, to which we ourselves instinctively respond” (SYC 71). Addams views the city as built around the possibility of factory production but ignores the needs of future workers. Among “juvenile delinquents,” Adams finds many young people who simply seek adventure and excitement because their lives have little of it. Had Addams merely abstracted youth as a category of individuals who seem prone to break the law, she could have easily found principles to judge them negatively. However, Addams saw them as humans, many of whom she witnessed growing up in the neighborhood, and she cared for them beyond the alienating label of “troubled youth.”",

        "text": " More than merely prefiguring care ethics, Addams infuses a high social responsibility standard into this moral approach. Addams advocates a duty of social awareness and engagement, thus creating the potential for care. Many care ethicists are wary of the notion of duty as it has been traditionally formulated. Moral duties have historically entailed claims regarding actions that a person is required to offer on behalf of another. Because the “other” is an abstract other and the requirements are universalized (I must act in such a way in all cases), duties toward others have tended toward moral minimums of obligation. For example, a moral obligation to act is present if someone’s life is in peril and minimal effort is required to prevent it, such as an infant drowning in 3 inches of bathwater. Although such cases get widespread agreement, it becomes more challenging to ascertain what obligation one has to distant others with unclear expectations of success. For example, many Americans have disposable income that could save the life of someone in a poverty-stricken country on a distant continent; do they have a moral obligation to give them money, and to what extent? Addams constructs the duty to care differently. Hers is an epistemological demand. Addams claims that good citizens actively pursue knowledge of others—not just facts but a more profound understanding—for the possibility of caring and acting on their behalf: “if we grow contemptuous of our fellows, and consciously limit our intercourse to certain kinds of people whom we have previously decided to respect, we not only tremendously circumscribe our range of life, but limit our scope of ethics” (DSE 8). For Addams, care ethics must be actively pursued, not passively fostered. Addams’ language is more assertive than much of the current care ethics discourse.",

        "text": " Finally, Addams extends care ethics to the public realm. She is not content to compartmentalize personal and social morality. Caring is what she desires for democracy and its various institutions. Addams views the residents of social settlements, for example, as having “an opportunity of seeing institutions from the recipient’s standpoint” because they are not distant institutions but neighbors. She finds this perspective significant and believes that it should ultimately “find expression in institutional management” (OVS 39). Furthermore, she differentiates the epistemological project of the settlement from the university in language that acknowledges a caring element: “The settlement stands for application as opposed to research; for emotion as opposed to abstraction, for universal interest as opposed to specialization” (FSS 189). While social settlements epitomize a democratic endeavor for Addams, she applies the same caring values to other institutions. The creation of the juvenile courts in Chicago represented an example of caring because it mandated contextualized regard for the context of young people. The creation of adult education that addressed tangible and contemporary issues also demonstrated a caring regard for the needs of Hull-House neighbors. Perhaps most of all, the comportment of the Hull-House residents manifested care ethics in their willingness to listen, learn and respond. Addams viewed socializing care as participating in a rich ideal of democracy.",

Jürgen Habermas, Germany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's student and assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from the interdisciplinary character of his research and of the Frankfurt School to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness with which he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially from Kant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporary Western society.

From these years come his provocative critiques of mass culture and the culture industry.

What motivates such triple domination is an irrational fear of the unknown: “Humans believe themselves free of fear when there is no longer anything unknown. This has determined the path of demythologization … . Enlightenment is mythical fear radicalized” (DE 11).

The means of destruction may be more sophisticated in the modern West, and the exploitation may be less direct than outright slavery, but blind, fear-driven domination continues, with ever greater global consequences.

The first thesis allows them to suggest that, despite being declared mythical and outmoded by the forces of secularization, older rituals, religions, and philosophies may have contributed to the process of enlightenment and may still have something worthwhile to contribute.

Two Hegelian concepts anchor this project, namely, determinate negation and conceptual self-reflection. “Determinate negation” (bestimmte Negation) indicates that immanent criticism is the way to wrest truth from ideology. A dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment “discloses each image as script. It teaches us to read from [the image's] features the admission of falseness which cancels its power and hands it over to truth” (DE 18). Beyond and through such determinate negation, a dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment also recalls the origin and goal of thought itself. Such recollection is the work of the concept as the self-reflection of thought (der Begriff als Selbstbesinnung des Denkens, DE 32). Conceptual self-reflection reveals that thought arises from the very corporeal needs and desires that get forgotten when thought becomes a mere instrument of human self-preservation. It also reveals that the goal of thought is not to continue the blind domination of nature and humans but to point toward reconciliation. Adorno works out the details of this conception in his subsequent lectures on Kant (KC), ethics (PMP), and metaphysics (MCP) and in his books on Husserl (AE), Hegel (H), and Heidegger (JA).

According to Marx, bourgeois economists necessarily ignore the exploitation intrinsic to capitalist production. They fail to understand that capitalist production, for all its surface “freedom” and “fairness,” must extract surplus value from the labor of the working class. Like ordinary producers and consumers under capitalist conditions, bourgeois economists treat the commodity as a fetish. They treat it as if it were a neutral object, with a life of its own, that directly relates to other commodities, in independence from the human interactions that actually sustain all commodities. Marx, by contrast, argues that whatever makes a product a commodity goes back to human needs, desires, and practices. The commodity would not have “use value” if it did not satisfy human wants. It would not have “exchange value” if no one wished to exchange it for something else. And its exchange value could not be calculated if the commodity did not share with other commodities a “value” created by the expenditure of human labor power and measured by the average labor time socially necessary to produce commodities of various sorts.

Building on Max Weber's theory of rationalization, Lukács argues that the capitalist economy is no longer one sector of society alongside others. Rather, commodity exchange has become the central organizing principle for all sectors of society. This allows commodity fetishism to permeate all social institutions (e.g., law, administration, journalism) as well as all academic disciplines, including philosophy. “Reification” refers to “the structural process whereby the commodity form permeates life in capitalist society.” Lukács was especially concerned with how reification makes human beings “seem like mere things obeying the inexorable laws of the marketplace” (Zuidervaart 1991, 76).",

The root cause, Adorno says, lies in how capitalist relations of production have come to dominate society as a whole, leading to extreme, albeit often invisible, concentrations of wealth and power (ND 189–92). Society has come to be organized around the production of exchange values for the sake of producing exchange values, which, of course, always already requires a silent appropriation of surplus value. Adorno refers to this nexus of production and power as the “principle of exchange” (Tauschprinzip). A society where this nexus prevails is an “exchange society” (Tauschgesellschaft).",

Politically and economically he responds to a theory of state capitalism proposed by Friedrich Pollock during the war years. An economist by training who was supposed to contribute a chapter to Dialectic of Enlightenment but never did (Wiggershaus 1994, 313–19), Pollock argued that the state had acquired dominant economic power in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and New Deal America. He called this new constellation of politics and economics “state capitalism.” While acknowledging with Pollock that political and economic power have become more tightly meshed, Adorno does not think this fact changes the fundamentally economic character of capitalist exploitation.
