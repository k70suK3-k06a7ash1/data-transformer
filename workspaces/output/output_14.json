        "text": " Intuitively, a Tarskian interpretation of an applied non-modal language represents a possible world, a way in which the properties and relations expressed by the predicates of the language might be exemplified by the things in the universe of the interpretation. The idea underlying possible world semantics is simply to interpret a modal language \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) by bringing a collection of Tarskian interpretations together to represent a modal space of many possible worlds in a single interpretation of  \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\).[33]  So let \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) be the result of adding the modal operator \\(\\Box\\) to some standard first-order language \\(\\scrL\\). As with a Tarskian interpretation of \\(\\scrL,\\) an SQML interpretation \\(\\calM\\) for \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) specifies a nonempty set \\(D\\) to serve as its universe. Also as in Tarskian semantics, \\(\\calM\\) assigns each term \\(\\tau\\) of \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) a semantic value \\(\\tau^\\calM \\in D\\). Additionally, however, \\(\\calM\\) specifies a nonempty set \\(W\\)—these are typically called the set of “possible worlds” of \\(\\calM\\) but can be any nonempty set. One member \\(w^\\ast\\) of \\(W\\) is designated as the “actual world” of \\(\\calM\\). To give substance and structure to these “worlds”, \\(\\calM\\) then assigns extensions to the predicates of \\(\\scrL_\\Box\\) relative to each world—that is, for every n-place predicate \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\scrL\\) and each world \\(w \\in W,\\) \\(\\calM\\) assigns a set \\(\\pi_w^\\calM \\subseteq D^n\\) of n-tuples of members of \\(D,\\) the extension of \\(\\pi\\) at  \\(w\\);[34]  in particular, the extension \\(=_w^\\calM\\) of the identity predicate at all worlds \\(w\\) is stipulated to be \\(\\lbrace\\langle a,a\\rangle:a \\in D\\rbrace\\). In this way \\(\\calM\\) represents the different ways that the properties and relations expressed by those predicates can change (or not) from world to world.",

This might lead one to wonder whether SQML, by building necessitism into its logical foundations, has (from a possibilist perspective) gotten the logical cart before the philosophical horse. On reflection, however, it is clear that necessitism is, not only a natural complement to possibilism, but an essential component of it. For, as we’ve seen, the central justification for possibilism is that it provides truthmakers for modal propositions like  (2);  it grounds them in the modal properties of individuals. If the purported truthmakers for those propositions could fail altogether to be, if it could be that there are no such things, then, for all we know, it might just as well be that there are in fact no such things and, hence, that there are no truthmakers for  (2)  and its ilk after all; and with that, possibilism’s central philosophical justification collapses.

The possibilist, however, will respond that the worry here has badly conflated existence in the sense of being, in the sense of mere identity with something, and existence in the sense of actuality.

(Spinoza  might be ascribed such a view, insofar as  God-or-Nature  is taken to be concrete and is, ultimately, the only concrete thing.) For typical actualists, however, it is fundamental to their view that there are in fact many contingent beings, many things that could have failed to be identical with anything; reality could have altogether lacked many things that just happen to exist. A natural (if, as we’ll see, not entirely unproblematic) way of expressing this is to say that there are possible worlds where at least some things in the actual world are simply absent; more generally, it is to say that what exists—that is, for the actualist, what there is in the broadest sense—varies from world to world.

The challenge is then how (or whether) to revise the principle in question, and this in turn often requires a choice between several competing possibilities, each of which may require further revisions still. Kripke himself avoids several options that might suggest themselves in light of the invalidity of Q2 in KQML. For instance, taking a lead from Prior (1957: 33–35), an actualist might argue that terms—individual constants and variables (when they occur freely)—are directly referring expressions like proper names and demonstratives and, hence, that an accurate model theoretic representation of actualism should require that the value \\(\\tau^\\calK\\) that \\(\\calK\\) assigns to an arbitrary term \\(\\tau\\) should be restricted to the domain of the actual world \\(w^\\ast\\) of \\(\\calK\\)—one cannot, after all, refer to individuals that don’t actually exist. This modification of KQML would indeed preserve the validity of Q2 but at the cost of invalidating Nec—notably, it would render the inference from line 1 to line 2 in the above proof invalid. For, while line 1 might now be true at the actual world \\(w^\\ast\\) of an arbitrary interpretation \\(\\calK\\) because we’ve stipulated that \\(\\sfx^\\calK\\) exist in \\(w^\\ast,\\) that very fact could well render line 1 false at some other world \\(u\\): \\(\\forall \\sfx \\Box \\neg \\sfB\\sfx\\) might be true at \\(u\\) but our actually existing individual \\(\\sfx^\\calK,\\) although not in the extension of \\(\\sfB\\) in the actual world, might well be in its extension at \\(u\\).
